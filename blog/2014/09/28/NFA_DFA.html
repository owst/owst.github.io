<p>Two well known mathematical models of computation are finite automaton, either
Non-deterministic or deterministic: NFA and DFA, respectively. Intuitively,
whereas NFAs can be “smaller”, it is “simpler” to match strings against DFAs.
In this post, we investigate a NFA that has an <em>exponentially larger</em> DFA,
showing off the “cost of determinism”.</p>

<p>First, lets define DFAs and NFAs:</p>

<h2 id="dfas">DFAs<a class="header_link" href="#dfas">🔗</a>
</h2>

<p>A finite automaton is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A (finite) set of states with finitely-many transitions between states,</li>
  <li>Each transition has a single-character label,</li>
  <li>Each state has an outgoing transition with each label,</li>
  <li>Some states are “initial”, and some states are “accepting”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s an example of an automaton:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/2014-09-28/0fffc4b1005038f00af6f4ed39df5383.svg" alt="NFA with hash 0fffc4b1005038f00af6f4ed39df5383"></p>

<p>Here, 0 is initial, and 2 is accepting.  We can “consume” a string of
characters (also referred to as “matching” the string by the DFA)  by taking
appropriately-labelled transitions between states: in each state we consider
the next character of the string, taking a transition labelled with that
character, and then considering the next character, and so on. We say a word
(sequence of characters) is “accepted” by the automaton if we can consume the
string by starting in an initial state, and ending (i.e. when the whole string
is consumed) in an accepting state.</p>

<p>For example, the word “xyyx” is accepted by the previous automaton, but “yyy”
is not (we can’t reach 2, starting at 0).</p>

<p>The “language” of an automaton is the collection of all strings that it
accepts. If an initial state is also accepting, then the automaton can accept
the empty string, written as ε.</p>

<p>The previous example of an automaton is “deterministic”: for each state, and a
particular label choice, there is exactly one outgoing transition with that
label.</p>

<p>I’ll now give some more examples, along with their languages.</p>

<p>A DFA, but has an empty language (no accepting states):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/2014-09-28/d11a39d0592ccdf4fdac0896b1a0b1e9.svg" alt="NFA with hash d11a39d0592ccdf4fdac0896b1a0b1e9"></p>

<p><em>Not</em> a DFA - multiple transitions from state 0 with label ‘a’:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/2014-09-28/50ba84e91c215fa557439ad79e6eb6a1.svg" alt="NFA with hash 50ba84e91c215fa557439ad79e6eb6a1"></p>

<p>A DFA that has the language of all even-length binary strings:</p>

<p><code>ε, 00, 01, 10, 11, 0000, 0001, ...</code></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/2014-09-28/8d5cc97fb3877cfb0929d233cac28596.svg" alt="NFA with hash 8d5cc97fb3877cfb0929d233cac28596"></p>

<h2 id="nfas">NFAs<a class="header_link" href="#nfas">🔗</a>
</h2>

<p>A <em>non</em>-deterministic finite automaton (NFA), lifts the restriction on
transitions: we can have multiple (or zero!) transitions from a single state
with the same label. For example:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/2014-09-28/a0c4c207e61ab1ada4c1ce751987d05c.svg" alt="NFA with hash a0c4c207e61ab1ada4c1ce751987d05c"></p>

<p>which has the language of all words beginning with ‘a’, and finishing with zero
or more ‘b’s, or those beginning with ‘a’ and ending with zero or more ‘c’s.</p>

<p>Now, why would we want to use a NFA instead of a DFA? The answer is
“compactness”: we can use fewer states to recognise the same language. Indeed,
NFAs and DFAs can recognise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton#Equivalence_to_DFA">exactly the same languages</a>.
The drawback is that the NFA is “harder” to match a string against: since we
can have a choice of transitions to take, we must try each, accepting a string
if <em>any</em> of our choices succeed (finish in an accepting state)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So, to summarise, a DFA is more efficient to “run” on a string, but a NFA is
more efficient to represent, a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_tradeoff">time-vs-space tradeoff</a>!</p>

<p>Now the question is, <em>how much</em> more compact is an NFA vs. a DFA. Or, put
differently, how much bigger is a DFA compared to an NFA recognising the same
language?</p>

<h2 id="a-tricky-case">A Tricky Case<a class="header_link" href="#a-tricky-case">🔗</a>
</h2>

<p>Consider the language of binary strings that have a ‘1’ at a fixed position
within the string (say two characters from the end of the string, obviously
forcing the length of the words to be &gt;= 3):</p>

<pre>
    (0|1)<sup>*</sup>1(0|1)<sup>2</sup>
</pre>

<p>for example, the following strings <em>are</em> in the language:</p>

<pre><u>1</u>00, 00<u>1</u>11, 10<u>1</u>01, 111<u>1</u>11</pre>

<p>and the following <em>are not</em>:</p>

<pre>ε, <u>0</u>00, 11<u>0</u>11, 00<u>0</u>01</pre>

<p>Now, in general, this language is, for any natural number n (which is the
minimum length of the words):</p>

<pre>
    (0|1)<sup>*</sup>1(0|1)<sup>(n - 1)</sup>
</pre>

<p>but we’ll stick with the n=3 case, for now. We can easily design an NFA for
this language:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/2014-09-28/4d306b466f4a91d26cb0dec57205c5d8.svg" alt="NFA with hash 4d306b466f4a91d26cb0dec57205c5d8"></p>

<p>Now, what does the DFA that accepts this language look like? To find out, we
can perform the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerset_construction">powerset construction</a> to “determinise”
a NFA. We can easily (but tediously) perform the powerset construction,
creating a table to record the possible <em>set</em> of states the NFA can be in
(after starting in the set containing the initial state), and check how this
set changes as we take transitions with either label:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>NFA State Set</th>
      <th>0 Label</th>
      <th>1 Label</th>
      <th>DFA State</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>{0}</td>
      <td>{0}</td>
      <td>{0,1}</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{0,1}</td>
      <td>{0,2}</td>
      <td>{0,1,2}</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{0,2}</td>
      <td>{0,3}</td>
      <td>{0,1,3}</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{0,1,2}</td>
      <td>{0,2,3}</td>
      <td>{0,1,2,3}</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{0,3}</td>
      <td>{0}</td>
      <td>{0,1}</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{0,1,3}</td>
      <td>{0,2}</td>
      <td>{0,1,2}</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{0,2,3}</td>
      <td>{0,3}</td>
      <td>{0,1,3}</td>
      <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>{0,1,2,3}</td>
      <td>{0,2,3}</td>
      <td>{0,1,2,3}</td>
      <td>7</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Now, we draw this as a DFA: the start state is the set containing the initial
states and the accepting states are those states whose set contains a accepting
state of the original NFA:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/2014-09-28/d493b6ff5dda16e41c02867cb036f8ff.svg" alt="NFA with hash d493b6ff5dda16e41c02867cb036f8ff"></p>

<p>We’ve gone from a 4 state NFA to a 8 state DFA, and in general, from a n + 1
state NFA to a 2<sup>n</sup> state DFA - this is the “exponential blowup” of
converting a NFA to DFA.</p>

<p>Now, let’s see if we can see why we’ve had this blowup.</p>

<h2 id="explaining-the-blowup">Explaining the blowup<a class="header_link" href="#explaining-the-blowup">🔗</a>
</h2>

<p>As a first step to explaining the structure of the DFA, let’s create a DFA to
match a subset of the final language:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/2014-09-28/91c56ff2fda8af18fd2533bc2db133b2.svg" alt="NFA with hash 91c56ff2fda8af18fd2533bc2db133b2"></p>

<p>The language of this DFA is <code>0<sup>*</sup>1(0|1)<sup>2</sup></code> in
other words, we can match the desired strings, as long as the first ‘1’ appears
2 characters before the end of the string.</p>

<p>Now, consider what happens if we have more characters to match, when we reach
state 4,5,6 or 7; in other words, the ‘1’ we matched when moving between state
0 and 1 wasn’t the ‘1’ that was 2 characters before the end of the string.</p>

<p>Call the 1 that seperates the two sections of the word the <em>switch</em>; the
initial part is the arbitrary-length <em>leader</em> and the final part is the
fixed-length <em>trailer</em>.</p>

<p>The NFA is able to choose a particular ‘1’ to be the switch, by
non-deterministically (or indeed, trying one choice, and if it fails,
backtracking to try the other choice) treating the ‘1’ as part of the leader,
<em>or</em> as the switch. Only once the NFA has made this choice does it match the
fixed-length trailer.</p>

<p>A DFA can’t have this non-deterministic choice, so every time the DFA sees a
‘1’, it must allow it to be <em>either</em> the switch or part of the leader. This
insight shows us the way to understanding the DFA: once we’ve seen two more
characters, we can decide if the ‘1’ was part of the leader, or the switch,
depending on whether there are any further characters to consume. Indeed, after
seeing these two extra characters, we have 8 choices for what to do next: 2
choices for each 2-character string (one for ‘0’ and one for ‘1’). These
choices are:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>2 additional characters</th>
      <th>0 action</th>
      <th>1 action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>00</td>
      <td>Go back to the initial state (no ‘1’ in the last 3 chars)</td>
      <td>Go back to the state where we’ve just seen the potential switch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>01</td>
      <td>Go the state reached after seeing “0” after the switch</td>
      <td>Go to the state reached after seeing “1” after the switch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>Go to the state reached after seeing “00” after the switch</td>
      <td>Go to the state reached after seeing “01” after the switch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>Go the state reached after seeing “10” after the switch</td>
      <td>Stay in the same state</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In other words, each of the 4 choices leads to a different pair of states, thus
we must have a different state for each of these 4 choices. If we add in
transitions as desribed in the previous table, we obtain the same DFA as was
generated by the subset construction.</p>

<p>Now, lets <em>prove</em> that we <em>must</em> have exponentially more states for this
particular language.</p>

<h2 id="why-must-we-have-exponentially-more-states">Why <em>must</em> we have exponentially more states?<a class="header_link" href="#why-must-we-have-exponentially-more-states">🔗</a>
</h2>

<p>Assume that we have a DFA with fewer than <code>2<sup>3</sup></code> states
and has language <code>(0|1)<sup>*</sup>1(0|1)<sup>2</sup></code>.</p>

<p>Now, by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle">pidgeonhole principle</a>, there must be 2
<em>distinct</em> strings in <code>(0|1)<sup>3</sup></code>, that lead to the same
state of the DFA. Let us call these two strings <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>; since they are
different, there must be a position, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> (with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0 &lt; i &lt; |x|</code>) in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>, at which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x[i] /= y[i]</code>, let us assume<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x[i] = 1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y[i] =
0</code>.</p>

<p>Now, let <code>z = 11</code>, clearly, we have <code>z ∈
(0|1)<sup>2</sup></code>, so it is a valid trailer. Now, we have that “xz” <em>is</em>
in the langauge, since it has the switch and the required two characters and
that “yz” <em>is not</em> in the language, since it has a ‘0’ in the switch position,
which should be ‘1’. However, both composite words lead to the same state (we
have added a common suffix to two strings that lead to the same state), which
is a contradiction. Our only assumption was that we had fewer than
<code>2<sup>3</sup></code> states, which must therefore be a bad assumption.
Put differently, we <em>must</em> have <code>2<sup>3</sup></code> states in any DFA
reconising this tricky language!  Indeed, we can easily generalise the argument
to any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code>, not just 3.</p>

<p>And we’re done! To sum up:</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="header_link" href="#summary">🔗</a>
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>NFAs and DFAs recognise the same set of languages, the “regular languages”,</li>
  <li>NFAs can be exponentially smaller than DFAs recognising the same language,</li>
  <li>DFAs, however, are simpler to compute with,</li>

      <p>An alternative approach is to use <em>backtracking</em>, where note the point at which we made a choice, and if we fail (consume the string without ending in an accepting state), we reverse backwards in the string and retrace our steps to the noted state, and try again, taking the next choice of transition instead, and so on. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
