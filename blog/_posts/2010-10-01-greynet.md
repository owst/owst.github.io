title: Linux Kernel Greynet implementation (RFC6018)
---
Last year I completed my 3rd year project, entitled "Facilitating the
Collection and Analysis of Suspicious IPv4/6 Network Activity using a Greynet".
The aim of the project was to build a test implementation for the then
unreleased ["RFC 6018 - IPv4 and IPv6 Greynets"][rfc].

My objective was to create a working prototype of a dynamic greynet. To do this
I made modifications to the Linux kernel (v2.6.31) which I have now made
available [here][code_link].  The Greynet
forwards incoming packets that do not receive a valid ARP/ND response to a
configurable IP address/port.
To use the Greynet, a few function calls need to be inserted into the
neighbour.c file within the net/core folder. An example diff is given
[here][diff_link].

For more information about IPv4 and IPv6 Greynets, see the RFC. For any
questions relating to my code please feel free to [pop me an email](mailto:{{site.email}}).
