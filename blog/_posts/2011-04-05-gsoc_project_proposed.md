I've just submitted my [project proposal](http://wiki.darcs.net/DarcsBridge) to Google, to work on [Darcs](http://darcs.net/) this summer. 
[Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/) is a Google project, paying students to hack on an open source project for the summer.
For details of what I've proposed, see the [Darcs wiki entry](http://wiki.darcs.net/DarcsBridge) I've created.

Now, let the waiting begin!
