Yesterday I received confirmation that my Darcs GSoC project proposal has been
accepted; this summer I'll be working on creating/improving a "bridge" between
Darcs and other VCSs, such as Git (for more information, see [the Darcs wiki
page of my project](http://wiki.darcs.net/DarcsBridge)).

This blog will host my weekly GSoC updates, when the coding period starts in
late May.

Thanks to all in Darcs team who helped me flesh out my proposal (special
mentions to Eric, Ganesh and Jason - thanks guys!), I'm very much looking
forward to my summer!
