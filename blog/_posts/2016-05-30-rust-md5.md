title: Rust MD5
---

As a little project to get started with learning [Rust][rust], I knocked
together a simple implementation of [MD5][md5]. Since this is a toy project,
I made no attempt to obtain high-performance. For example, I simply read all
input data before starting processing, rather than streaming.

The usage should be familiar from `md5sum`: 

```bash
> echo 'hi there' | ./target/debug/rust_md5
12f6bb1941df66b8f138a446d4e8670c -
```
or

```bash
> echo 'unicode, ok âœ”' > file.txt
> ./target/debug/rust_md5 file.txt
34a7fafe48ccb9d3f18f09949cbfa96f file.txt
```

Take a look at the implementation available on [GitHub, here][github]. One part
that I think is quite cool is the [usage of macros][macros] to make the
specification of the [operations of each round][neat] quite a bit neater.
