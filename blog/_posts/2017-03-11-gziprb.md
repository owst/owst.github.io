title: gziprb - Gzip implemented in Ruby
---

Over the last few months, I have created [`gziprb`][github], a pure-Ruby
implementation of the famous [GZIP][3]/[DEFLATE][7] format. It is (definitely!)
not optimised for performance, but was instead created as a learning exercise
to try and understand the gzip format. It was certainly interesting to
understand the bit-packing, storage-optimisation and low-level deflate
algorithm that go together to create gzip.

We can run some very simple tests to make sure the basics are working (the
[project specs][specs] contain many more-involved examples than this!).

Compressing:

```bash
> echo 'ABCabcabcXYZ11111ABC' | bundle exec exe/gziprb | gunzip
ABCabcabcXYZ11111ABC
```

Decompressing:

```bash
> echo 'ABCabcabcXYZ11111ABC' | gzip | bundle exec exe/gunziprb
ABCabcabcXYZ11111ABC
```

Please [take a look][github] and maybe give `gziprb` a try!
