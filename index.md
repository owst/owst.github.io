Hi, I'm Owen,

I live in [Woking][woking] and work as a software developer at [Bamboo][bamboo]
writing mostly Ruby. Previously, I completed a PhD at Southampton University,
where I also obtained a masters in Computer Science.

Outside of work I enjoy programming in Haskell, and ignoring technical things my interests include playing waterpolo, skiing, playing the electric guitar, windsurfing, and watching MotoGP &amp; F1.

Please have a look around; I very infrequently [blog][blog] about technical
things, have linked to my [open source contributions][oss] and discussed my
PhD/masters [research papers][research].

If you'd like to say hi, please send me an email: [{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}).
