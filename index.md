Hi, I'm Owen,

I live in London, working as a programmer at a startup using a mixture of Java
and Ruby. I recently completed my PhD at Southampton University, where I
also obtained a masters in computer science.

Outside of work I enjoy programming in Haskell, and ignoring technical things
my interests include windsurfing, playing waterpolo, skiing,
playing the electric guitar, and watching MotoGP &amp; F1.

If you'd like to say hi, feel free to do so via email:
