Hi, I'm Owen,

I live in London, working as a programmer at a startup using a mixture of Java
and Ruby. Previously, I completed a PhD at Southampton University, where I also
obtained a masters in Computer Science.

Outside of work I enjoy programming in Haskell, and ignoring technical things
my interests include windsurfing, playing waterpolo, skiing,
playing the electric guitar, and watching MotoGP &amp; F1.

Please have a look around; I infrequently [blog][blog] about technical things,
have linked to my [open source contributions][oss] and discussed my PhD/masters
[research papers][research].

If you'd like to say hi, feel free to do so via email:
