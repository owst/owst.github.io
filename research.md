My research topics to date include model checking of Petri Nets (in particular, *compositional* reachability checking) and functional programming languages (specifically, methods of implementing IO).

**Compositional model checking of Petri Nets**:

My PhD research focussed on compositionally checking reachability in systems modeled by Petri nets. My PhD thesis *Compositional specification and reachability checking of net systems* is [available online][thesis], and includes the work from three papers I co-authored:

- *Compositional Reachability in Petri Nets*, [Reachability Problems '14][rp]<br/>
    with Julian Rathke and Paweł Sobociński, [paper (PDF)][rppaper]

- *A Programming Language for Spatial Distribution of Net Systems*, [Petri Nets '14][pn]<br/>
    with Paweł Sobociński, [paper (PDF)][pnpaper]

- *Penrose: Putting Compositionality to Work for Petri Net Reachability*, [CALCO'13][calco]<br/>
    with Paweł Sobociński, [paper (PDF)][calcopaper]

**IO in functional programming languages**:

My masters research project investigated methods of implementing input/output (I/O) in functional
programming languages: [report (PDF)][report].
